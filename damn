Design the system with a premium, fluid user experience using a centralized global UI component library.

1. Smooth Transitions & Motion Design
Use subtle 150–300ms ease-in-out animations

Page transitions with fade + slight upward motion

Modal open/close with scale + opacity animation

Timeline nodes animate sequentially on load

Hover states with soft elevation & shadow shift

Micro‑interactions for buttons, toggles, and alerts

Skeleton loaders instead of hard loading screens

Avoid abrupt layout shifts (use layout stabilization)

2. Global UI Component Library (Single Source of Truth)
Create a reusable, centralized design system including:

Core Components

Buttons (Primary, Secondary, Danger, Ghost)

Input Fields (Text, Currency, Date, File Upload)

Modals (Confirm, Form, Alert, Preview)

Toast Notifications

Status Chips

Timeline Node Component

Financial Card Component

Project Overview Card

Data Tables (sortable + filterable)

Dropdowns & Multi-select

Tabs & Accordion Panels

Tooltip System

3. Design System Rules
Consistent 8px spacing grid system

Soft rounded corners (12–16px)

Subtle layered shadows

Light & Dark theme support

Centralized color tokens (primary, success, warning, danger)

Global typography scale

Reusable animation presets

4. Performance & Flow
Lazy loading for heavy screenshot galleries

Component-level state isolation

Optimistic UI updates

Debounced search inputs

Smooth horizontal timeline scrolling

5. UX Philosophy
The system should feel:

Calm

Fluid

Intelligent

Executive-level

Never cluttered

Never abrupt

Every interaction should feel intentional and refined.
